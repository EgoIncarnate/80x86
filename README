sim
---

Instruction set simulator, emulates the 8086 instruction set, but is not cycle
accurate.  This is designed as a golden reference for hardware development and
for designing microcode and not for performance - there are already high
performance simulators available.  Each opcode is implemented as a single
function which can then be turned into microcode at a later date.  All of the
emulation unit tests should be reusable in the hardware verification
test-bench without modification.
