# Locate SDL_image library
#
# This module defines:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
#   SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
#   SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
#   SDL_F_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_ttf
#
#
#
# For backward compatiblity the following variables are also set:
#
# ::
#
#   SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
#   SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
#   SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)
#
#
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
